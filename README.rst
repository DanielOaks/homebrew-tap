homebrew-tap
============

These are my homebrew formulas â€“ for my own packages, or just formulas I've written that aren't in master (and probably won't be put there).

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew tap danieloaks/homebrew-tap
    $ brew install --HEAD <formula>

Formulas
--------

This repo currently supplies these formulas:

* `dashpipe <https://github.com/DanielOaks/dashpipe>`_: a silly text conversion tool

Any formulas, code etc in this repo is public domain.
